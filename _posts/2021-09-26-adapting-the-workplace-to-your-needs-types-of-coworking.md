With so many options out there, it's essential to figure out which type of workspace is right for you. This post discusses several common types of coworking and what they offer to different workers.

## 1. General coworking

General coworkings offer a collaborative space that is not specialised for any particular industry. This type of coworking generally provides a comfortable environment where people can work together productively.

With a variety of coworkers from different backgrounds, you can develop your projects faster and more effectively. These spaces are most often located in large cities worldwide with varying ranges of price depending on the neighbourhood or locality.

A general coworking allows you to

- Increase productivity in the workplace
- Encourage creativity, collaboration, and innovation
- Create your community and make professional connections
- Work whenever you want, without schedules or limits

## 2. Coworking by profession

Another way to find your ideal coworking space is by profession or industry. Different jobs require different types of shared workspaces, so sometimes it's no easy task to find a place with everything you need.

For example, freelancers working in art, media, or design may not have to meet the exact requirements as someone who works in technology or practices law or law. It's essential to think about the type of project you're working on when looking for a space to best suit you.

In this type of collaborative space, you can work with other creatives or artists involved in projects similar to yours.

People in creative workspaces also share tips on how to make the most of their time there. Not only is it possible that you will make great friends while working in this space, but you also learn about the industry and how to work efficiently.
