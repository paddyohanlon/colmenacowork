### Restaurants in Prado del Rey

- [Iptuci](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608975-d5599898-Reviews-Meson_Rural_Iptuci-Prado_del_Rey_Sierra_de_Grazalema_Natural_Park_Province_of_Cad.html): If you eat meat, try the goats leg (cabrito al romero). They also have veggie options. Iptuci supplies much of their produce, meat, eggs, and cheese from their farm.
- [Caico's](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608975-d2010477-Reviews-Caico_s-Prado_del_Rey_Sierra_de_Grazalema_Natural_Park_Province_of_Cadiz_Andaluci.html): A little more pricey, but the food is always great. It's the best place for seafood.
