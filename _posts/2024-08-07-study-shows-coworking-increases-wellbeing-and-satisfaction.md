A study by Marko Orel, Martin Lukes, and Jan Zouhar, published in the [Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JSBED-04-2023-0151/full/html) in June 2024, sheds light on how coworking spaces play a pivotal role in supporting remotely working micro-entrepreneurs. Let's delve into the key findings and practical implications from this insightful research.

## The Heart of the Study

The study aimed to explore the impact of coworking spaces on the wellbeing and entrepreneurial satisfaction of micro-entrepreneurs, particularly focusing on those who work remotely. Through a mixed-method approach involving quantitative surveys and qualitative focus groups, the researchers gathered comprehensive data to understand the multifaceted benefits of coworking spaces.

## Key Findings

### Enhanced Wellbeing and Work-Life Balance

One of the standout findings of the study is the significant improvement in wellbeing and work-life balance experienced by micro-entrepreneurs who use coworking spaces. These spaces provide more than just a place to workâ€”they offer a structured environment that helps in separating work from personal life, which is crucial for mental health and productivity.

A quote from the study reads:

> You can separate the personal life and work-life in a way that I was not doing when I was a working home as a remote freelancer. So, for me, it mentally works like this. I need this physical separation to change my mind and focus more on what I am doing.

### Community and Networking

Coworking spaces foster a sense of community and offer ample networking opportunities. This social support network is invaluable for micro-entrepreneurs, who often work in isolation. Being part of a coworking community helps reduce feelings of loneliness and opens doors to collaborative opportunities and knowledge sharing.

> Using a coworking space helps because you are part of a community. So, you feel you are a part of it. Even if you do not attend the events, you are still somehow a member or part of something; I think that can help many freelancers not feel so isolated and just on their own. So just the feeling of being part of it can be enough.

### Special Benefits for Women and Parents

The benefits of coworking spaces are particularly pronounced for women and micro-entrepreneurs with young children. These spaces help in managing work-family boundaries more effectively, reducing stress and enhancing overall life satisfaction. For women juggling professional and family responsibilities, coworking spaces provide a conducive environment to focus on work without the typical household distractions.

> I can be very productive instead of working at home for six hours because I will be interrupted every 30 minutes. I can come to a coworking space and do the work in four hours; then, I can spend two quality hours with my daughter. I think that this is helping me work less time but be more productive and then have more time. What I feel is quality of life.

## Practical Implications

The study's findings have practical implications for various stakeholders:

1. **Micro-Entrepreneurs**: For those working remotely, especially women and parents, coworking spaces offer a balanced and productive work environment. The physical separation from home and the supportive community can significantly enhance both professional output and personal wellbeing.

2. **Policymakers**: There's a need to recognize and support the role of coworking spaces in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Policies encouraging the development of such spaces, especially in residential areas, can help more micro-entrepreneurs access these benefits.

3. **Coworking Space Providers**: Designing coworking spaces to meet diverse needs can attract a broader range of users. Incorporating family-friendly facilities, quiet zones, and communal areas can make these spaces more appealing to micro-entrepreneurs with different work styles and personal obligations.

## Concluding Thoughts

Francesco and I obviously believe in the value of coworking, but it's fascinating and validating to read data supporting our personal experience.

Personally, I was happy working at home until my first daughter was born, then I quickly realised that separating work from family life would be hugely beneficial. Dropping my little girl to school, then heading to [La Colmena](/en/) to work helps me focus, and gives a much appreciated break from the endless tasks to be done at home.

If you'd like to try coworking, come join us for a day with no obligation and see if it works for you.
