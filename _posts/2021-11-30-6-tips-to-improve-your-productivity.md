## How to Measure Productivity

The world of work can be complicated to navigate. Being aware of how much time is spent on projects and tasks for an employer or client means that the employer or client is getting their money's worth from the worker and not just wasting hours doing things that don't contribute to achieving objectives in any meaningful way.

Productivity at work could be measured in one of two ways: by the amount of work done or by the amount of value created by the items produced.

It will make sense for those who choose to work in a more relaxed way to relate the results obtained with time model.

You may have heard the phrase _“the difference one person makes can be more than their words,”_ and in this case, it's true. Professionalism goes beyond what you do and how well you work: it also means the attitude you have when doing that work.

The work environment, peer relations, or customer satisfaction are factors that influence the overall productivity of an employee on a given project and, in turn, affect both quantitative results and indirect influences, such as those mentioned above (work environment), which have a direct impact on improving performance and, indirectly, for enhancing the quality of products and services offered to customers.

## 1. Make a list of your tasks and prioritise them according to importance.

Start with the most important or least time-consuming tasks first. This will give you the momentum you need to keep going. Get up from your desk regularly and stretch your legs, go for a walk or get some light exercise.

It’s easy to get lost in hours of uninterrupted work without even realising you've been hunched over in the same spot for long hours.

Also, remember to stay hydrated with plenty of water. Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day. There are days when the workload is heavier than usual, so it's best not to try to cram everything into one day.

## 2. Apply productivity techniques

Productivity techniques are used for a variety of reasons. Some people use them to increase their productivity at work, others use them to reduce stress, and some use them because they want to be more focused.

Here are a couple of techniques to enhance productivity.

### A. Establish goals for yourself

Setting goals is an excellent way to make sure you have something to work towards. It helps you measure your progress and is good motivation because it keeps you on track with direction.

### B. Plan your day

We all have a lot to do in a day, so it's essential to plan your time wisely. Take some time and figure out what needs to be done and in what order. That way, when something comes up during work hours, you can have a better chance of maneuvering the situation appropriately and of avoiding wasting time on confusion.

### C. Keep up with your tasks

Whether you have important tasks or many small ones, the best way to keep on top of them is to write them down. It's been found that if you write down what you have to do each day, your subconscious takes over and naturally helps you remember things.

### D. Split large tasks into smaller activities

One of the best ways to accomplish almost anything is to break it down into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time. For example, if you are working on a project that includes 10 distinct steps, focus only on the first step until it is completed. Once you've finished the first one, you move on to the remaining steps in order.

### E. Start with the most straightforward tasks and then move on to the more difficult ones.

When working on a project, it is also vital to prioritise the most critical tasks. That way, if something goes wrong, you'll know which task will have implications if it's not completed on time. Get a jump-start, whenever you can, with the most manageable tasks first. Then move on to the more difficult ones.

### F. Take breaks of about 10/15 minutes every hour or two

Taking breaks is just as important as sitting down and working. Taking a few minutes to stretch, take a walk or even pause for coffee or snacks can make your productivity more efficient and help you be happier throughout the day. Studies have shown that [people who take frequent breaks are more productive than those who do not. ](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190312-the-tiny-breaks-that-ease-your-body-and-reboot-your-brain)

### G. Avoid distracting elements while working

When trying to concentrate on a given project or task, it is essential to avoid any distractions. Consider limiting distractions with social media or pausing notifications for a short period of time. One of the most important aspects of being productive is having a clean and distraction-free work environment.

## 3. Use time management tools

There are many different time management tools available. You can buy a planner or make one yourself. You can create your time management system by setting personal or professional goals and scheduling tasks to help you get things done and move forward. You can also purchase some of the available apps on the market today that will create a virtual organiser for your life.

## 4. Set clear, reasonable, and measurable objectives.

Setting objectives is not challenging; what is challenging is setting the right purpose. If your objective is not clear, reasonable, and measurable, the chances of achieving that goal are much lower.

That brings us to the following questions:

- What is your ultimate goal?
- What do you want to achieve?
- How will you know when you have achieved it?

### A. Identify what you want to achieve

Before you start the task, identify what you want to achieve. Are there any special requirements? What are the needs of the project or activity you have to carry out? Be sure to capture all of this in a document on your computer or paper and pencil for reference during the process.

### B. Write down the following steps to achieve the objective.

To achieve your goal, you must take action. The first thing you need to do is plan what you are going to do each day. Determine the goal you want to achieve, and then list all the steps that must be taken to achieve it.

### C. Create a calendar to complete the steps

An excellent way to get organised is to use a calendar or planner. It is crucial to set deadlines for each task and cross them off as you complete them.

### D. Evaluate your progress at regular intervals and make any necessary adjustments or changes.

Working on a project for a long time with no end in sight can be discouraging. Be sure to evaluate your progress at regular intervals and make any necessary adjustments.

## 5. Invest in quality education and improve your skills

Being a professional is no easy task, and it takes more than intelligence and hard work to get far. Investing in education is a great way to improve your talents and skills and become a more productive professional.

There are many careers and specialised courses on [online learning platforms](https://www.themuse.com/advice/14-best-sites-for-taking-online-classes-thatll-boost-your-skills-and-get-you-ahead) that can lead someone on the path to becoming a professional expert in their field.

Investing in training is a sure bet to improve your competitiveness and productivity. Continuous professional development keeps you on top of trends, motivating productivity and leading to new growth opportunities.

## 6. Rent a different kind of coworking space
