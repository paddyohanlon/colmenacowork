Do you work remotely and are interested in coworking?

We plan to open **La Colmena Coworking** in Prado del Rey. A shared office in the Sierra de Cadiz. A place to share ideas, develop and improve your business ideas, and have some social interaction we’ve all been so badly missing.

La Colmena coworking will open its doors in the beginning of 2022. The space has been be created as a non-profit association so we can make it as affordable as possible and reinvest any profit in improving the space.

## What’s on offer?

Our intention is to provide:

- A stylish and comfy open-plan office space where you can rent a desk. Warm and cosy in the winter, cool and fresh in the summer, so you can work comfortably and productively all year round.
- Great wifi.
- Video conference room for private meetings and calls.
- Community events to get to know one another, to share ideas and support each other.
- Secure and flexible 24/7 access to the space. Work the times that best suit you.

### What is a coworking space?

At its simplest, **a coworking space** is an open plan shared office space where anyone can rent desk space and come to and work. More than that though, it’s a place to create community, share ideas and support each other.
