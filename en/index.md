### What is a coworking space?

At its simplest, **a coworking space** is an open plan shared office space, where anyone can rent desk space and come to work. More than that though, it’s a place to create community, share ideas and support each other.

Read our blog post [Coworking: what is it and how does it work?]({% post_url 2021-09-06-coworking-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work %}).

## Who is it for?

La Colmena is **for anyone who works from home:** remote worker, entrepreneur, digital nomad, etc.

If you work from home, a coworking could be great for you. It helps you create a **healthy work-life balance**. Come and work in a friendly and social environment!

Also, you can benefit from having a professional business address and use our meeting room for meetings with clients or colleagues.

## How does it work?

You can rent a permanent desk per month.

A permanent desk is for your use exclusively, where you can leave your computer and belongings. With this option you get your own key to the space and access 24/7.

### Hot desk

You can rent a hot desk daily or weekly.

A hot desk, or flexible desk, means you choose from one of the non-permanent desks. The desk can vary depending on availability each day. With this option you have access to the space during office hours: 8am to 8pm.

### Meeting room
