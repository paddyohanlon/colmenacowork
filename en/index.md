Do you work remotely in Prado del Rey and are interested in coworking?
{: .large }

We plan to open **La Colmena Coworking** in Prado del Rey. A place to share ideas, develop your business, and have some social interaction we’ve all been so badly missing.

Provided the COVID situation improves, La Colmena coworking will open its doors in 2021. The space will be created as a non-profit association so we can make it as affordable as possible and reinvest any profit in improving the space.

## What’s on offer?

Our intention is to provide:

- A stylish and comfy open-plan office space where you can rent a desk. Warm and cosy in the winter, cool and fresh in the summer, so you can work comfortably and productively all year round.
- Great wifi.
- Video conference room for private meetings and calls.
- Community events to get to know one another, to share ideas and support each other.
- Secure and flexible 24/7 access to the space. Work the times that best suit you.

### What is a coworking space?

At its simplest, **a coworking space** is an open plan shared office space where anyone can rent desk space and come to and work. More than that though, it’s a place to create community, share ideas and support each other.

> Coworking is about creating a better place to work, and, as a result, a better way to work. Coworking spaces provide more than just office space. They are community centres, friendly gathering places, think tanks. When you rent a desk or an office, you gain coworkers to bounce ideas off and that support you professionally in a way that you can’t find working from home or in the corporate office. &mdash; Jamie Orr

### How much will it cost?

We’re still working this out. It will depend a lot on the space we find and how many people are interested. Our plan so far is to create a non-profit association and to make it as affordable as possible.

### Where will it be located?

In Prado del Rey, Cádiz. We are still looking for a location, so if you know of one, get in touch!
